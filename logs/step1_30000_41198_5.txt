Process 3532101 has 10.52 GiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 56.84 GiB memory in use. Process 2318697 has 6.61 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 56.29 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 55.26 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
